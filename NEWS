User-visible changes in udns library.  Recent changes on top.

0.0.6 (08 Apr 2005)

 - use double sorted list for requests (sorted by deadline).
   This should significantly speed up timeout processing for
   large number of requests.

 - changed debugging interface, so it is finally useable
   (still not documented).

 - dnsget routine is now Officially Useable, and sometimes
   even more useable than `host' from BIND distribution
   (and sometimes not - dnsget does not have -C option
   and TCP mode)

 - Debian packaging in debian/ -- udns is now maintained as a
   native Debian package.

 - alot (and I really mean alot) of code cleanups all over.
